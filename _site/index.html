      <p>Hi ! I’m a french Master’s degree student in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, at the École des Ponts ParisTech. I am currently doing an internship on speech features processing algorithms based on machine learning techniques. You can find my resume <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I a currently doing an internship in the Cognitive Machine Learning team, a joint ENS and INRIA research team at the intersection between cogntitive and computer science. I am implementing speech features extraction algorithms in <strong><a href="https://docs.syntheticlearner.net/shennong/">shennong</a></strong>, a toolbox based on <a href="https://kaldi-asr.org">Kaldi</a> in development in CoML.</p>

<p>The first speech processing technique I am implementing is the <em>vocal tract length normalization</em>, a speech normalization technique aiming to compensate for the fact that speakers have vocal tracts of different sizes, by warping the frequency-axis of the spectra of the speaker by a learned factor (click <a href="./speech.html">here</a> for more details).</p>

<p>Next, I will implement in the toolbox a <em>pitch detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network</em> operating directly on the time-domain waveform input, using the <a href="https://github.com/marl/crepe">CREPE</a> model.</p>

<p>Last November, I had the opportunity to be a part of Explore Machine Learning, a Google-sponsored program for students to get started with machine learning. As a student facilitator, I organized and facilitated workshops at my campus to help other students learn the basic concepts of machine learning and walk towards some more advanced concepts.</p>

<p>I organized two workshops, for around one hundred students in total; helping them understand the core ideas of ML and implement their first models with Keras. At the end, I shared feedback and best practices with the Explore ML Team at Google and with the other facilitators.</p>

<p>I am currently a second year student (equivalent to a first year of MSc) at the École des Ponts ParisTech in the department of applied mathematics and computer science. I notably followed those courses this past year:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Operational Research</li>
  <li>Statistics, Optimization, Stochastic Processes</li>
  <li>Evolution Equations, Functional Analysis, Control Theory</li>
</ul>

<p>I organized organized voluntary tutoring sessions for around 80 pupils between 11 and 17 years old from local schools, to make them discover science in a fun way. I prepared experiments with our team of 5 members among the organization and, as Vice-president, I planned museum visits and managed relationships between Dévelop’ponts and the École des Ponts. Experiences included 3D printing, introduction to programming, physics and chemistry experiments, Arduino projects…</p>

<p>I also organized with Dévelop’Ponts voluntary homework help sessions for high-school pupils.</p>
