Hi ! I'm a french Master's degree student in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, at the École des Ponts ParisTech. I am currently doing an internship on speech features processing algorithms based on machine learning techniques. <!-- You can find my resume [here](/assets/resume.pdf). !-->
# Experience 
* * *
## Research Engineer Intern 
### <span> ENS Paris / INRIA, CoML team </span> 06/2019 - 12/2020


I a currently doing an internship in the Cognitive Machine Learning team, a joint ENS and INRIA research team at the intersection between cogntitive and computer science. I am implementing speech features extraction algorithms in __[shennong](https://docs.syntheticlearner.net/shennong/)__, a toolbox based on [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org) in development in CoML. 

The first speech processing technique I am implementing is the *vocal tract length normalization*, a speech normalization technique aiming to compensate for the fact that speakers have vocal tracts of different sizes, by warping the frequency-axis of the spectra of the speaker by a learned factor (click [here](./speech.html) for more details).

Next, I will implement in the toolbox a *pitch detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network* operating directly on the time-domain waveform input, using the [CREPE](https://github.com/marl/crepe) model.

## Student facilitator
### <span> Google, Explore ML </span> 11/2019 - 08/2020

Last November, I had the opportunity to be a part of Explore Machine Learning, a Google-sponsored program for students to get started with machine learning. As a student facilitator, I organized and facilitated workshops at my campus to help other students learn the basic concepts of machine learning and walk towards some more advanced concepts.

I organized two workshops, for around one hundred students in total; helping them understand the core ideas of ML and implement their first models with Keras. At the end, I shared feedback and best practices with the Explore ML Team at Google and with the other facilitators.


# Education
* * *
## Master's degree, Applied mathematics and Computer Science  
### <span> École des Ponts ParisTech </span> 2018 - 2022
I am currently a second year student (equivalent to a first year of MSc) at the École des Ponts ParisTech in the department of applied mathematics and computer science. I notably followed those courses this past year:
* Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Operational Research
* Statistics, Optimization, Stochastic Processes
* Evolution Equations, Functional Analysis, Control Theory

## Preparatory classes
### <span> Lycée Montaigne </span> 2016 - 2018
Before that, I spent two years in preparatory classes for the highly competitive entrance exams to the *Grandes Écoles*, consisting of intense preparation in maths and physics.


# Voluntary Work
* * *
## VP Social Open-mindedness
### <span> Dévelop'Ponts </span> 2019 - 2020
I organized organized voluntary tutoring sessions for around 80 pupils between 11 and 17 years old from local schools, to make them discover science in a fun way. I prepared experiments with our team of 5 members among the organization and, as Vice-president, I planned museum visits and managed relationships between Dévelop’ponts and the École des Ponts. Experiences included 3D printing, introduction to programming, physics and chemistry experiments, Arduino projects...

I also organized with Dévelop'Ponts voluntary homework help sessions for high-school pupils.
