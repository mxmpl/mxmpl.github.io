In this project, I developed an AI which can play Tetris by using a genetic algorithm. 

The AI looks for the best move for a given tetromino by trying out all the possible moves for this tetromino and the next one. The score of one move is computed by doing the dot product between a vector of parameters of the AI and a vector of grid data, composed of the aggregate height, complete lines, holes and bumpiness. The genetic algorithm then gets the best parameters for the AI.
